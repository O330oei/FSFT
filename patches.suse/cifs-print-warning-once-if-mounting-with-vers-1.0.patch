Subject: [PATCH] cifs: print warning once if mounting with vers=1.0
Patch-mainline: Not yet, in for-next branch
References: bsc#1144333

We really, really don't want people using insecure dialects
unless they realize what they are doing ...

Add print once warning if mounting with vers=1.0 (older SMB1/CIFS
dialect) instead of the default (SMB2.1 or later, typically
SMB3.1.1).
