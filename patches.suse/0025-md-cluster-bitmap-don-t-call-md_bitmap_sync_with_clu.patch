Subject: [PATCH] md-cluster/bitmap: don't call md_bitmap_sync_with_cluster
 during reshaping stage
Git-commit: cbce6863b6d04f6eac6b144bcfaaf11a189d6533
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1
References: bsc#1166003

When reshape is happening in one node, other nodes could receive
lots of RESYNCING messages, so md_bitmap_sync_with_cluster is called.

Since the resyncing window is typically small in these RESYNCING
messages, so WARN is always triggered, so we should not call the
func when reshape is happening.
