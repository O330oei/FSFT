Subject: [PATCH] md: don't set In_sync if array is frozen
Git-commit: 062f5b2ae12a153644c765e7ba3b0f825427be1d
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1166003

When a disk is added to array, the following path is called in mdadm.

Manage_subdevs -> sysfs_freeze_array
               -> Manage_add
               -> sysfs_set_str(&info, NULL, "sync_action","idle")

Then from kernel side, Manage_add invokes the path (add_new_disk ->
validate_super = super_1_validate) to set In_sync flag.

Since In_sync means "device is in_sync with rest of array", and the new
added disk need to resync thread to help the synchronization of data.
And md_reap_sync_thread would call spare_active to set In_sync for the
new added disk finally. So don't set In_sync if array is in frozen.
