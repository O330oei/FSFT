Subject: bnxt_en: Fix TC queue mapping.
Git-commit: 18e4960c18f484ac288f41b43d0e6c4c88e6ea78
Patch-mainline: 5.6-rc1
References: networking-stable-20_02_05

The driver currently only calls netdev_set_tc_queue when the number of
TCs is greater than 1.  Instead, the comparison should be greater than
or equal to 1.  Even with 1 TC, we need to set the queue mapping.

This bug can cause warnings when the number of TCs is changed back to 1.
