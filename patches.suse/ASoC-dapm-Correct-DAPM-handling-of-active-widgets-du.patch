Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dapm: Correct DAPM handling of active widgets during shutdown
Git-commit: 9b3193089e77d3b59b045146ff1c770dd899acb1
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc5
References: bsc#1051510

commit c2caa4da46a4 ("ASoC: Fix widget powerdown on shutdown") added a
set of the power state during snd_soc_dapm_shutdown to ensure the
widgets powered off. However, when commit 39eb5fd13dff
("asoc: dapm: Delay w->power update until the changes are written")
added the new_power member of the widget structure, to differentiate
between the current power state and the target power state, it did not
update the shutdown to use the new_power member.

As new_power has not updated it will be left in the state set by the
last DAPM sequence, ie. 1 for active widgets. So as the DAPM sequence
for the shutdown proceeds it will turn the widgets on (despite them
already being on) rather than turning them off.
