Subject: [PATCH] PM: core: Fix handling of devices deleted during system-wide
 resume
Git-commit: 0552e05fdfea191a2cf3a0abd33574b5ef9ca818
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v5.6-rc1

If a device is deleted by one of its system-wide resume callbacks
(for example, because it does not appear to be present or accessible
any more) along with its children, the resume of the children may
continue leading to use-after-free errors and other issues
(potentially).

Namely, if the device's children are resumed asynchronously, their
resume may have been scheduled already before the device's callback
runs and so the device may be deleted while dpm_wait_for_superior()
is being executed for them.  The memory taken up by the parent device
object may be freed then while dpm_wait() is waiting for the parent's
resume callback to complete, which leads to a use-after-free.
Moreover, the resume of the children is really not expected to
continue after they have been unregistered, so it must be terminated
right away in that case.

To address this problem, modify dpm_wait_for_superior() to check
if the target device is still there in the system-wide PM list of
devices and if so, to increment its parent's reference counter, both
under dpm_list_mtx which prevents device_del() running for the child
from dropping the parent's reference counter prematurely.

If the device is not present in the system-wide PM list of devices
any more, the resume of it cannot continue, so check that again after
dpm_wait() returns, which means that the parent's callback has been
completed, and pass the result of that check to the caller of
dpm_wait_for_superior() to allow it to abort the device's resume
if it is not there any more.
